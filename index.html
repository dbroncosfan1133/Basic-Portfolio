                <p>Hi, my name is Curtis.  I am currently a Production Supervisor at a PCB Manufacturing facility.  I manage the Surface Finish Department 
                    with 8 different processes and 24 employees. I am responsible for tracking priority orders through my department, approving/declining
                    vacation requests, scheduling overtime, working with engineering to make changes to processes, tracking quality by reject codes, annual
                    performance reviews, and much more.</p>
            <p>I am learning how to code professionally and look forward to using those skills in a new career path. 
                I love everything electronics related and have a passion for PC's. I have built 3 of my own personal 
                computers, a home theater PC (HTPC), a personal Unraid Server with a Plex Media Server docker and 
                a docker for doing automatic file backups, and sadly haha, :) my prize possession, a high-end gaming 
                rig complete with a custom watercooled loop.</p>
